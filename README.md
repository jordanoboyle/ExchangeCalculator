This is a simple exchange rate calculator using a 3rd party API and vanilla JS. The intent is to learn a little something from completing this project and ultimately apply it to my personal website as a showcase of knowledge. 

Full disclosure, while I understand every line, this was built with coaching and guidance from other sources, not just my own brain. While I do plan on tweaking here and there, some things that already work will remain unchanged.
