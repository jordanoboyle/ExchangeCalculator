# Exchange Rate Calculator

This is a simple exchange rate calculator built using vanilla JavaScript and a third-party API. The primary goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of working with APIs and applying this knowledge to my personal website as a showcase of my skills.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/free) to fetch real-time currency exchange rates. While I’ve developed this with guidance and coaching from various sources, I fully understand every line of code. I plan to continue tweaking the project, although some functional parts may remain unchanged.

## Features

- Fetches real-time exchange rates using the `FETCH` API.
- Supports 32 different currencies with the flexibility to add more.
- Simple and intuitive interface to swap between currencies and view exchange rates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in VSCode. It’s a straightforward and enjoyable way to serve your project.

- **Live Server Extension**: [ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Instructions

1. **Install Live Server**: If you haven't installed the Live Server extension, you can do so from the VSCode marketplace.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your VSCode.
3. **Start the Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
   - Alternatively, click on the **Go Live** button in the bottom right corner of VSCode.
4. **Access the Application**: Your browser should automatically open with a local server running on port `5500`.

If you prefer using another local server like MAMP, feel free to do so.

### Using the Calculator

- **Select Your Currency**: Choose the currency you want to start with.
- **Swap and Calculate**: Click on the swap button to get an accurate conversion output.
